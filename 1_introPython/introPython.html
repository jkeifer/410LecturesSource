## What is python?

A high-level dynamic programming language with extensive GIS and data analysis applications

- Interpreted

- Dynamically typed

- Uses whitespace

- Cross-platform (caveat: windows seems to have less support)

- Current version is 3.4.x, but most scientific and geospatial packages require 2.7.x

## What is python?

Do you have my favorite fruit, a simple example:

```py
favorite = "peach"
inventory = ["apple", "banana", "pear", "orange", "guava"]

# iterate through list of fruit inventory
for fruit in inventory:

    # see if fruit is same as favorite
    if fruit == favorite:  # test inline comment
        
        # .format is string method, replaces {} with fruit
        print "You have my favorite fruit, {}.".format(fruit)
        
        # in this case, break out of loop to stop testing
        break

# notice indentation level: else goes with for loop, not if
else:
    print "You donâ€™t have my favorite fruit."
```

## Basic Data Types
---
.left-column[
  ## Basic Data Types
  ### - Integers
]
.right-column[
  Integers store positive and negative numbers without decimals:

```py
>>> type(5)
<type 'int'>  # int means integer

# ints support typical numerical operations:
>>> (2 + 5) ** 2 - 10 * 8
-31
```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## Basic Data Types
  ### - Integers
  ### - Floats
]
.right-column[
  Like integers, but used for decimal values:

```py
>>> type(13.45)
<type 'float'>
```

  WARNING: Watch out for integer division:

```py
>>> type(17 / 5)
<type 'int'>  # what? why?

>>> 17 / 5
3             # integer division drops decimals!

>>> 17.0 / 5  # add a .0 to either side for
3.4           # floating-point division
``` 
]
---
.left-column[
  ## Basic Data Types
  ### - Integers
  ### - Floats
  ### - Strings
]
.right-column[
Strings hold text and other characters:

```py
>>> type("5 is a number.")
<type 'str'>

>>> 'this is also a string'

>>> """as is this"""  # used for spanning multiple lines

>>> "strings have special characters like \t, \n, \r..."

>>> print "a \\t looks like \t."  # escape \ with another \
'a \t looks like        .'        # \t is a tab character
```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## Basic Data Types
  ### - Integers
  ### - Floats
  ### - Strings
]
.right-column[
String can also be concatenated and sliced:

```py
>>> s1 = "foo"

>>> s2 = "bar"

>>> concat = s1 + s2
'foobar'

>>> concat[4]  # get character at index 4 (the fifth letter)
'a'

>>> concat[0:2]  # slice from 1st character (0) TO 3rd (2)
'fo'

>>> concat[:2]  # does the same thing
'fo'

>>> concat[2:]  # ommitting 2nd index goes to end
'obar'

>>> concat[-2:]  # can use negative indicies for slice
'ar'
```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## Basic Data Types
  ### - Integers
  ### - Floats
  ### - Strings
  ### - Lists
]
.right-column[
Lists hold collections of items:

```py
>>> fruit = ["apple", "banana", "pear", "orange", "guava"]

>>> things = ["car", 3, 5.32, 't']  # holds multiple types
```

Lists can also be concatenated and sliced:

```py
>>> l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]

>>> l2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]

>>> l1[0] + l2[2:]
[1, 7, 8]
```

Individual elements can be replaced as lists are *mutable*:

```py
>>> l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]

>>> l1[3] = 67

>>> print l1
[1, 2, 3, 67]
```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## More Basic Data Types
  ### - Tuples
]
.right-column[
Tuples are like lists, but *immutable*:

```py

>>> t1 = (1, 2, 3, 4)

>>> t2 = (5, 6, 7, 8)

>>> t1 + t2
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)

>>> t1[:3]
(1, 2, 3)

>>> t1[2]
3

>>> t1[2] = 356
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## More Basic Data Types
  ### - Tuples
  ### - Sets
]
.right-column[
Sets are like tuples and lists, functioning as a collection of objects. However, sets can only contain one of any object:

```py
>>> l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]

>>> l1 * 3
[1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]

>>> set(l1 * 3)
set([4, 1, 2, 3])  # order is not maintained
```
] 
---
.left-column[
  ## More Basic Data Types
  ### - Tuples
  ### - Sets
  ### - Dictionaries
]
.right-column[
Dictionaries are key-value stores. That is, look up a key to find its value:

```py
>>> d = {"John": 26, "Henry": 44, "Maria": 34, "Olaf": 13}

>>> d["John"]
26
```

Dictionaries can hold other dictionaries:

```py
>>> feature41 = {"name": "Library", "size": 5789}

>>> feature93 = {"name": "School", "size": 15765}

>>> features = {41: feature41, 93: feature93}

>>> print features
{41: {'name': 'Library', 'size': 5789},
93: {'name': 'School', 'size': 15765}}

>>> features[93]["name"]
'School'
```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## More Basic Data Types
  ### - Tuples
  ### - Sets
  ### - Dictionaries
  ### - Booleans
]
.right-column[
- Booleans are used for logic, to hold `True` or `False`.

- Cannot have any other values

- `True` and `False` are reserved words in python
]
---
template: inverse
## Flow Control
---
.left-column[
## Flow Control
### - Conditional Statements
]
.right-column[
Allows different operations depending on given conditions:

```py

>>> x, y = 37, 99

# use ==, <, >, <=, >=, != for comparisons
>>> if x >= 25:
...     if y == 99:
...         z = 5
...     elif y > 1:
...         z = 12
... else:
...     z = 17
# what is z?

# False, 0 of any type, an empty sequence like "", [], (),
# an empty mapping like {}, and None all evaluate as false
>>> if 0:
...     print "true"
... else:
...     print "false"
'false'
```
]
---
.left-column[
## Flow Control
### - Conditional Statements
]
.right-column[
```py
# can use not, and, or to combine statements
>>> if not ((5 or 0) and not (True or False)):
...     # what will we get?

# null is None in python, and is an identity
# test idenity using is, not ==
>>> if something is not None:
...     print "There is one of these"
```
]
---
.left-column[
## Flow Control
### - Conditional Statements
### - While Loops
]
.right-column[
While loops are used to repeat operations until a condition is met:
```py
# don't do this: infinite loop
>>> while True:
...    pass

# this is okay -- effectively a do-while loop
>>> i = 0
>>> while True:
...     i += 1
...     if i > 5:
...         break

# this is better
>>> i = 0
>>> while i <= 5:
...     i += 1
# what will i be?
```
]
---
.left-column[
## Flow Control
### - Conditional Statements
### - While Loops
### - For Loops
]
.right-column[
For loops are used to *iterate* over an *iterable*:
```py
# lists are iterable
>>> fruits = ["apple", "banana", "pear", "orange", "guava"]
>>> for fruit in fruits:
...     print fruit
'apple'
'banana'
'pear'
'orange'
'guava'

# range() and xrange() can generate a list of #s
>>> sum = 0
>>> for number in xrange(4, len("nondeterministically"), 2):
...     sum += number
>>> print sum
88

# list comprehension uses for; strings are iterable
>>> str1 = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
>>> list1 = [l for l in str1 if l in "zyghseivnsaby"]
>>> print list
['a', 'b', 'e', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'n', 's', 'v', 'y', 'z']
```
- tuples are iterable
- dictionaries are iterable: loop over keys
- file objects are iterable: loop over lines
]
---
.left-column[
## Flow Control
### - Conditional Statements
### - While Loops
### - For Loops
### - Try/Excepts
]
.right-column[
The try/except pattern can be used to handle *exceptions*:
```py
# an exception
>>> x1 = 5

>>> x2 = "hello"

>>> print x1 + x2

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

# execution stops with an unhandled exception


>>> try:
...     print x1 + x2
... except TypeError:
...     print "One or more arguments were of the wrong type."
... # finally executes with or without a handled exception
... finally:
...     print "Thanks for using our adding machine."

One or more arguments were of the wrong type.
Thanks for using our adding machine.

# execution can continue because the exception was handled
```
]

## Functions
---
## Functions

- Used to break complex operations into small, easily understood pieces

- Create modular, reuseable code

```py
>>> def funct(x):
...     return x

>>> funct(56)
56

>>> def square(x):
...     return x * x  # x is not same x in funct()

>>> square(4)
16

# some functions built-in, as we have seen
>>> len('This is a sentence composed of many characters')
46

>>> len([1, 2, 3, 4])
4
```
---
## Functions

We can put a bunch of this together:

```py
>>> FILE = "./file.txt."  # line are "first", "second", "third", etc.

>>> def get_sixth_char(string):
...     """Returns 6th char in a string, unless IndexError or newline"""
...     try:
...         char = string[5]
...     except IndexError:
...         char = None
...     else:
...         if char == "\n":
...             char = None
...     return char

>>> linecontent = {}

# with block ensures file closes safely
# open() is a function with two arguments, the first being the file to open,
# the second is the mode, in this case 'r' for read
>>> with open(FILE, 'r') as infile:
...     for linenumber, line in enumerate(infile):
...         linecontent[linenumber] = get_sixth_char(line)

>>> print linecontent
{0: None, 1: 'd', 2: None, 3: 'h', 4: None, 5: None, 6: 't', 7: 'h',
8: None, 9: None}
```

template: inverse
## Classes
---
## Classes

- Classes are objects

- Objects can have attributes, and you can do stuff to an object
  - Doors open, switches turn on and off

- Objects can be helpful and can clean up code, but are complex to implement

- GIS libs use objects extensively

- Everything in python is an object
  - strings, dicts, ints: all objects, with properties and .red[methods]

.footnote[\*a .red[method] is a function attached to an object]
---
## Classes

```py
class Person(object):

    # __init is a required method to initialize class
    def __init__(self, name, age, heightInches, weightPounds):
        # these are all class properties
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.heightInches = heightInches
        self.weightPounds = weightPounds

    def introduce(self, othername=None):
        """Class method to introduce Person"""
        if othername:
            # notice format is a method of the string class
            print "Hello {}. My name is {}.".format(othername, self.name)
        else:
            print "Hi, I'm {} and I am {}.".format(self.name, self.age)

    def getWeightInKilos(self):
        """Method returns Person weight in kilograms"""
        return self.weightPounds / 2.2

    def getHeightInMeters(self):
        """Method returns Person height in meters"""
        return self.heightInches * 2.54 / 100
```
---
## Classes

We can use our Person class like this:

```py
# construct an instance of the Person class
>>> fred = Person("Fred", 52, 73, 189)

# we see fred is a Person object
>>> fred
<__main__.Person object at 0x1088d2ed0>

# get properties of fred instance
>>> print fred.name, fred.age, fred.heightInches, fred.weightPounds
Fred 52 73 189

# use methods of Person class with fred instance
>>> fred.introduce(othername="Juan")
Hello Juan. My name is Fred.

>>> fred.introduce()
Hello, my name is Fred and I am 52 years old.

>>> fred.getWeightInKilos()
85.9090909090909
```

# Importing Functions and Classes
---
## Import Statements

- Functions and classes make code modular and reusable

- Many programmers much smarter than you or me have already created frameworks and utilites solving many problems

- Why try to reinvent the wheel?

--

<br/><br/>
.center[**Use what's already been done!**]
---
## Import Statements

- In python speak:
  - a module contains functions and/or classes
  - a package contains multiple modules

- The standard library contains many modules and packages.

- We can access them like this:

```py
>>> import os

>>> os
<module 'os' from '/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.8/Frameworks/Python.framework/V...
```
<br/><br/>
.center[Try it yourself. Then run `dir(os)` to see everything defined in the os package.]
---
## Import Statements

- We can import more than just the packages and modules in the standard lib:

```py
# any package that has been installed to the python we are using is available
>>> import arcpy

# we want to get OGR and GDAL, but they are modules in a package...
>>> from osgeo import ogr
>>> from osgeo import gdal

# want a specific function or class in a package?*
>>> from arcpy import Buffer_analysis

# think a function is long-winded in the name?*
>>> from arcpy import CreateFileGeodatabase_management as CreateFGDB
```
